# Problem Definition
The goal is to write a function that takes a string as input and returns an array containing all possible consecutive substrings. 
The order matters here, we must list all substrings starting from the first character, then all starting from the second character, and so on and so on.

# Pseudocode
1. Create an empty array called 'result' to store the substrings.
2. Start a loop (variable 'i') that goes from 0 up to the length of the string (start index).
    3. Inside that, start a second loop (variable 'j') that goes from 'i + 1' up to the length of the string + 1 (end index).
        4. Slice the string from index 'i' to index 'j'.
        5. Push this sliced segment into the 'result' array.
    6. End inner loop.
7. End outer loop.
8. Return the 'result' array.

# Big O Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(n^2)**

1. **Scalable Element:**
   The scalable element is the length of the input string, which we call *n*.

2. **Looping Elements:**
   - We have an **outer loop** that iterates *n* times (once for every character in the string).
   - We have an **inner loop** that iterates roughly *n* times as well (decreasing by 1 with each step of the outer loop).

3. **Calculation:**
   Since we have a nested loop structure where the number of operations is directly related to the square of the input size (n * n), the time complexity is Quadratic.
   
   If the input string length increases, the time to complete the operation increases quadratically. For example, if the string length doubles, the work required roughly quadruples.
